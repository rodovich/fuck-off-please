Custom stylesheet to hide entrypoints to Gemini sprinkled throughout Google Workspace.

## Installing

Safari: Open Settings. Under **Advanced**, next to **Style sheet:**, choose **Otherâ€¦** and navigate to this file.

Other browsers: I think there are extensions that let you load custom stylesheets. Maybe you can ask Gemini how to do it.
